title: Updated the About page with a better overview

I did a major overhaul of [the About page](/2015-05-07/about.html#post-start). Rather than try to describe everything about the project in full generality (which wasn't working very well IMO), the new page now starts with a very concrete overview of the editor and then uses that to introduce some of the other ideas of the project. I think this works better for people who come to this site and wonder 'what the heck is this project'?

The [the About page](/2015-05-07/about.html#post-start) also has some neat videos showing recent progress on the editor.
