title: Now you can buy cool Unison t-shirts and stickers to support the project

There's now a [Zazzle store](http://www.zazzle.com/unisonweb/products) where you can purchase overpriced t-shirts and stickers as a way to support our work. Like the Patreon campaign, all income coming from here (after Zazzle takes their cut) will go toward supporting the open-source project.
